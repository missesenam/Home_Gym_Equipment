<h2> review of the most featured wearable technology </h2>

             <p>After jumping in with both feet and purchasing the 'Abs Stimulator,' I was pleasantly surprised. Simply stick it to your body, turn it on, and feel the pull through electro-magnetic sensors! You can adjust the device up to about 22 levels. I could feel it working anywhere between levels 8 and 10.</p>

                 <p>a chest strap is the best heart rate monitor if you want hyper-accurate heart rate data during exercise. However, it's unlikely you're going to want to wear a chest strap to bed - no judgment if you do - so an optical wrist strap will probably be the preference. However, when you get into this realm, if you already own one of the best smartwatches, you'll probably find it can already do what you need it to. </p>

                     <p>the Wahoo Tickr is the best heart rate monitor for anyone who wants a no-frills budget-price chest strap without all the bells and whistles with both Bluetooth and ANT+, and a strong warranty in the case of issues. </p>
                    </div>

                         <p>Occassional problems with it logging 100-200 steps in my sleep but I'm assuming I flail around a lot. Step counting is great for me, calories burned is probably a bit exaggerated. Workout coach is great, heart track sensor is great. I recommend cleaning with alcohol before every workout and making sure it's tight on your wrist to ensure best accuracy.</p>

                             <p>I was struggling to find one that fits. This one did. I'm a very broad in the shoulders and thick in the chest. Went from the military to Law enforcement and then retired last year, so I'm facing some weight gain that I want to deal with now rather that later. Needing additional weight resistance to my push ups and chin ups/pull ups. This works great for weight plates.</p>
